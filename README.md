# Automated-Cooling-System

The software integrated into the embedded system was developed using the Arduino IDE. The code autonomously controls the speed of the fan motor using the input value from the temperature sensor. A max and min temperature are set, if max, the fan will spin fast, if min, the fan will stop. When the temperature decreases the fan speed decreases proportionally. The LCD panel is used to display the current fan speed and the current temperature.
